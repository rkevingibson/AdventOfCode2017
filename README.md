# AdventOfCode2017
My solutions to 2017's advent of code. Done in C++, compiled with visual studio 2017.

My focus is mostly on coming up with relatively efficient solutions, rather than small solutions. I also am using this as a chance to explore the standard library a bit more, particularly the algorithms header.
I'm also experimenting with the filesystem header, which is upcoming but is in VS2017. It seems really nice so far, though I'm not really using it for much here.
